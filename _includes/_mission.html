<a href="{{ site.url }}/people/">We</a> study the biological basis of diseases caused by microbes -- whether it be a parasitic worm, a pathogenic bacterium, or a complex microbial community in the gut.  Our group makes up <a href="http://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/centers-initiatives/center/center-for-host-microbial-interactions/">the Center for Host-Microbial Interactions</a>, at <a href="http://www.vet.upenn.edu/">PennVet</a>, and our research leverages a diverse skill set that cuts across the disciplines of genomics, microbiology and immunology. We engage in <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/">collaborative projects</a> that benefit from close interactions with veterinarians and human clinicans alike. Our research embodies the idea of <a href="http://www.vet.upenn.edu/about/press-room/multimedia/one-health">'One-Health'</a> - that humans, animals and the enviroment are interconnected, and that we all live in a microbial world.  We are located at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu">The University of Pennsylvania</a>, in <a href="http://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/academic-departments/pathobiology/">The Department of Pathobiology</a>.
