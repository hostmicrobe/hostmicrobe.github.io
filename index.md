# About CHMI

![Full-width image](https://placehold.it/800x100){:.lead data-width="800" data-height="100"}

We study the biological basis of diseases caused by microbes -- whether it be a parasitic worm, a pathogenic bacterium, or a complex microbial community in the gut. Our group makes up the Center for Host-Microbial Interactions, at [PennVet](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/), and our research leverages a diverse skill set that cuts across the disciplines of genomics, microbiology and immunology. We engage in collaborative projects that benefit from close interactions with veterinarians and human clinicans alike. Our research embodies the idea of [One-Health]{:.heading.flip-title} - that humans, animals and the enviroment are interconnected, and that we all live in a microbial world. We are located at the The University of Pennsylvania, in The [Department of Pathobiology](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/research/academic-departments/pathobiology/).
