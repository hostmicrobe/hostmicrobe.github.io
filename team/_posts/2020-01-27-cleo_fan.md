Cleo was enrolled in the [Masters of Biotechnology](https://biotech.seas.upenn.edu/) program at UPenn.  As part of the molecular biology track within this program, Cleo did her independent study in the lab working with some of the bacterial isolates from our [canine IBD study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0740-4) to try to set-up in vitro systems to study microbe-microbe interactions between bile acid producers and pathobionts.  Unfortunately, this work was cut short by the COVID19 pandemic, but Cleo still finished her independent study virtually.
