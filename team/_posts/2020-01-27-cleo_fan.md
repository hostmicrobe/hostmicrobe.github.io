Cleo is enrolled in the [Masters of Biotechnology](https://biotech.seas.upenn.edu/) program at UPenn.  As part of the molecular biology track within this program, Cleo is doing her independent study in the lab and is working with some of the bacterial isolates from our [canine IBD study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0740-4) to try to set-up in vitro systems to study microbe-microbe interactions between bile acid producers and pathobionts.
