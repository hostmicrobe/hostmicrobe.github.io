Olivia was a PhD student in the lab and a member of the Microbiology, Virology and Parasitology (MVP) Graduate group from 2019 to 2024.  Olivia's project was focused on the development of genomic methods to study the skin-dwelling parasite, *Leishmania braziliensis*.  In her [first paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011230), she successful developed Selective Whole Genome Amplification (SWGA) for *Leishmania* species and used this technique to investigate the population biology of this parasite in South America. This work constitutes a breakthrough for the leishmania research field since it allows researchers to amplify whole *Leishmania* genomes directly from patient material to carry out population genetic studies of this important pathogen, without the need to culture or enrich parasites. Olivia also wrote the first [review article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012418) on SWGA, which laid out how this method has impacted population genomic studies for complex pathogens.
