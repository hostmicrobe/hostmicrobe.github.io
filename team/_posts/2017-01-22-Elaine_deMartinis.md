Elaine joined the lab as a visiting faculty member from Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo in 2017. Over the course of about 7 months, Elaine set-up our slow-turning lateral vessel (STLV) bioreactor for creating a 3D culture system that would allow us to model host-bacterial interactions *in vitro*. She then used cultures generated in these STLVs to optimize immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy assays to study intestinal 'organotypic' cultures.  When she wasn't working on this project, Elaine also made important contributions to advancing our shotgun metagenomics work, contributing to [this publication](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0740-4).
