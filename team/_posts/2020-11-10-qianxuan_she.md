Qianxuan is completing his first of three rotations in the lab and is a member of the Microbiology, Virology and Parasitology (MVP) Graduate group.  Qianxuan's project is focused on a bile acid-prodcing commensal, *Clostridium hiranonis*, which we initially identified as an important factor in modulating GI disease.  Due to COVID, Qianxuan has worked virtually to annotate a recently completed genome of *C. hiranonis*, while exploring published and unpublished shotgun metagenomic datasets to better understand this organism.
