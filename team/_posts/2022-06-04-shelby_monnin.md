Shelby is an veterinary student at UPenn (Class of '26) who spent the summer of 2023 in the lab working jointly with the PennVet Wildlife Futures program.  As a 'WF' student, Shelby split her time between bench work and field work.  She collected and identified hundreds of ticks recovered from White-tailed Deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) in PA state.  She extracted DNA from these ticks and ran QPCR tests for a range of pathogens, then used this data to select ticks for metagenomic sequencing.
