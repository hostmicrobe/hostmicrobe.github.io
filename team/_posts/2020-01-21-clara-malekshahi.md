Clara came to us straight out of her undergraduate studies at Smith College, where she worked in the laboratory of [Dr. Laura Katz](https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/laura-katz).  After learning the ropes, Clara became an incredibly effective manager of all high-throughput sequencing projects provided as a service by the lab.  Clara also spent time doing field work and made critical contributions to our metagenomics work in bats affected by White Nose Syndrome.  After two years as lab manager, Clara left the lab to start her Graduate program in the CAMB/MVP program at UPenn.  Lucky for us, we still get to see Clara every day â€“ she ended up joining the lab of [Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/), our lab neighbors and with whom we share a weekly lab meeting.  We're so proud of her and can't wait to see all that she accomplishes in the Moncla lab!
