Sam spent the Spring semester of his senior year in our lab as part of her final project for the [BIO376](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/content/biol376-microbial-diversity-pathogenesis-lab-0) course.  During this time, Sam worked closely with another undergraduate in the lab to analyze the microbiome in pregnant sows.  Although his time in the lab was relatively brief, he made important contributions to [our study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01089-8) that described the impact of parity (pregnancy history) on the microbiome.  After graduating from UPenn in 2017, Sam took a job at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), where studies the the impact of the microbiome on cancer immunotherapy.  Sam hopes to pursue a graduate degree in bioinformatics.
