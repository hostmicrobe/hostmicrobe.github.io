Amanda is a PhD student in the Immunology Graduate Group (IGG) and spent her 1st rotation with us.  The goal of Amanda's project was to interrogate the host transcriptional response during infection-induced dysbiosis, and to identify the microbes or microbial factors associated with inflammation leading to sepsis.  Amanda used an infection with Toxoplasma gondii to induce severe dysbiosis fand collected gut tissue, stool and created a microbial isolate collection from mice at 0, 2, 5, and 8 days post-infection. Amanda then worked to isolate RNA from these tissues and prepare sequence-ready libraries.  The goal of this project is to try to use RNAseq to simultaneous profile host and microbial gene expression during dysbiosis. This data set will provide insight into microbial community structure AND function during dysbiosis, as well as profiling the host response...all from the same sample.
