Ann completed her Ph.D. and postdoc in the laboratory of Danielle Bassett at UPenn, where she used network theory to address questions in cognitive neuroscience.  Ann's role on the team is to advance data analysis and visualization methods for our [microbiomeDB](http://microbiomedb.org/) project, and she works closely with the larger VEuPathDB team that is our partner in this effort.
