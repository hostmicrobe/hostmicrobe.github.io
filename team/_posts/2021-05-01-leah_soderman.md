Leah completed her veterinary degree at Kansas State University and is currently an internal medicine resident at PennVet.  Although Leah spends the majority of her time in the clinic, she will be working periodically in the lab to develop a residency research project.  This project will focus on using portable QPCR technology (Biomeme, Inc.) to develop and test assays for measuring gut dysbiosis in client-owned dogs.
