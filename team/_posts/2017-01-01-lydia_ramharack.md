Lydia spent the Spring semester of her senior year in our lab as part of her final project for the [BIO376](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/content/biol376-microbial-diversity-pathogenesis-lab-0) course.  During this time, Lyida worked closely with another undergraduate to analyze the microbiome in pregnant sows.  Although her time in the lab was relatively brief, she made important contributions to [our study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01089-8) that described the impact of parity (pregnancy history) on the microbiome.  After graduating from UPenn in 2017, Lydia began working as a Clinical Research Coordinator in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).
