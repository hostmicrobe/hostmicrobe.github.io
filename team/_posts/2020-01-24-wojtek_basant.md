Wojtek joined the lab in November of 2019 as our first *bona fide* software developer.  He came to us from the Sanger Institute, where he served as the primary developer of [Wormbase paraSite](https://parasite.wormbase.org/index.html).  His role on our team is to advance our [microbiomeDB](http://microbiomedb.org/) project, and he works closely with the larger VEuPathDB team that is our (essential!) partner in this effort.  Wojtek moved on to other software development projects with this larger team, but during his time with us he loaded large enteric disease datasets into microbiomeDB, built private user workspaces that allow users to directly upload and analyze their own data, developed an automated workflow that enables handling of shotgun metagenomic data, and built a new software tool (CORRAL) that allows investigators to identify microbial eukaryotes in complex metagenomic datasets. Wojtek now works as an independent compsci and compbio consultant.
