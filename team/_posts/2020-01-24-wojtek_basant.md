Wojtek joined the lab in November of 2019 as our first *bona fide* programmer.  He came to us from the Sanger Institute, where he served as the primary developer of [Wormbase paraSite](https://parasite.wormbase.org/index.html).  His role on our team is to advance our [microbiomeDB](http://microbiomedb.org/) project, and he works closely with the larger VEuPathDB team that is our (essential!) partner in this effort.  Wojtek has loaded large enteric disease datasets in microbiomeDB, developed private user workspaces that allow users to directly upload and analyze their own data, and developed an automated workflow that enables handling of shotgun metagenomic data.
