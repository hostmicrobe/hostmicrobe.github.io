Stephanie joined the lab in June 2022, the summer after her first year as a veterinary student at PennVet, as an NIH-BI veterinary scholar.  Steph was instrumental in starting our first microbiome study in little brown bats, where she combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to understand factors that impact the outcome of *P. destructans* infection, the fungal pathogen responsible for White Nose Syndrome, a disease that has devastated the bat populations in the U.S.  After completing this summer project and returning to her 2nd year in vet school, we were fortunate to be able to bring Steph back to the lab in the summer of 2023 as a [Penn Global Research Institutes (PGRI) fellow](https://global.upenn.edu/pennabroad/pgri).  With this opportunity, Steph was able to spend the entire summer in the Galapagos working on our One-Health projects in collaboration with the [Galapagos Education Research Alliance (GERA)](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/galapagos/).
