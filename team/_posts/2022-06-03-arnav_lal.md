Arnav is an undergraduate at UPenn (Class of '23) who came to us through the Galapagos Education and Research Alliance (GERA).  In the Summer of 2022 he joined others in our lab on a research trip to San Cristobol, Galapagos, where he was key in helping to develop portable sequencing methods to monitor natural water sources for potential pathogens.  Arnav is currently using computational tools to analyze the data he generated.  After he graduates from UPenn, he plans to being a dual MD/PhD program.
