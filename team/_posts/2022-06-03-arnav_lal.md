Arnav is an undergraduate at UPenn (Class of '23) who came to us through the Galapagos Education and Research Alliance (GERA).  In the Summers of 2022 and 2023 he joined others in our lab on a research trip to San Cristobol, Galapagos, where he was key in helping to develop portable sequencing methods to monitor natural water sources for potential pathogens.  Arnav is currently using computational tools to analyze the data he generated. Arnav was selected for the presitgious [Churchill Scholarship](https://curf.upenn.edu/node/11150) – one of only 16 students nationally –  which will allow him to complete a 1yr masters program at Churchill College at Cambridge.  After completing his masters, Arnav will begin an MD/PhD program at Harvard.
