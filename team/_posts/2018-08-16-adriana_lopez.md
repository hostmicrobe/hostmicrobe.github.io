Adri (PennVet class of '21) spent the summer of 2018 in the lab as a supported by a fellowship from [Biomeme](https://biomeme.com/).  She expanded our portable diagnostic capabilities by testing assays for equine strangles (*Strep. equi* equi).  Her data showed some promise for being able to detect this pathogen, and set the stage for future work by additional summer vet students.
