Kevin joined our lab in 2016 as a Vet student (Class of '19).  Over the course of about 2 years, Kevin worked in the lab on some of our early veterinary microbiome work, and he was instrumental in enabling us to collect, organize and process samples for our [canine IBD study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0740-4) and our [sow pregnancy study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01089-8), both of which he is a co-author on. Kevin is completing his veterinary pathology residency at the Royal Veterinary College in London.
