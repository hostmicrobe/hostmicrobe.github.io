Jenn (PennVet class of '20) spent the summer of 2017 in the lab as a [NIH-BI research fellow](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/education/research-training-opportunities/nih-BI-research-program).  She was the first person in the lab to begin using our [Biomeme](https://biomeme.com/) platform for portable QPCR detection of veterinary pathogens.  Working with our colleagues at the Pennsylvania Diagnostic Lab Services (PADLS) at our large animal hospital, she optimized portable assays for important avian disease, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and *Mycobacterium gallinarium* and *septicum* (Mg/Ms).
