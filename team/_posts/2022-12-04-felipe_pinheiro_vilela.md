Felipe graduated in Dentistry and has a Master's degree in Biosciences and Biotechnology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil, where he's currently a PhD student. Felipe has been working for over 10 years in the characterization of *Salmonella* serovars of importance in the "One Health" context. He's currently spending 6-months as a "sandwich" student during his PhD.  During his time in the lab, Felipe will learn computational methods to analyze RNA-seq data with the goal of identifying differences in the gene expression of *Salmonella Infantis* under conditions of stress. In his free time, you'll probably find Felipe cooking, reading thriller books or watching Marvel movies.
