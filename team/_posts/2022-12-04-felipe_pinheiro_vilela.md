Felipe graduated in Dentistry and has a Master's degree in Biosciences and Biotechnology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil, where he's currently a PhD student. Felipe has been working for over 10 years in the characterization of *Salmonella* serovars of importance in the "One Health" context. He spent 6-months as a Brazilian "sandwich" student during his PhD.  During his time in the lab, Felipe learned computational methods to analyze RNA-seq data with the goal of identifying differences in the gene expression of *Salmonella Infantis* under conditions of stress. As a side project, Felipe applied his microbiology expertise to our White Nose Syndrome (WNS) project.  He was the first person in the lab to begin culturing the causative agent of this disease, the fungus *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*, and his work laid an important foundation for some reductionist in vitro assays that we are developing to study WNS.  In his free time, you'll probably find Felipe cooking, reading thriller books or watching Marvel movies.
