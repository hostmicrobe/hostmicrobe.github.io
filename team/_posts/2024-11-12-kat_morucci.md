Kat is a VMD-PhD student at PennVet in the Biology Graduate Program.  Before coming to Penn, Kat completed her Masterâ€™s degree in Evolutionary Anthropology at UC Davis where she studied the antiquity of infectious veterinary diseases in the Peruvian Andes and developed a histological method to identify ancient disease processes in preserved soft tissues. Her current research interests are seated in understanding evolutionary disease ecology and the processes that give rise to modern infectious disease landscapes.  Kat is currently rotating in the lab and is working on one of our newest projects, in collaboration with the PA Game Commission, examining bacterial-fungal interactions in the skin microbiome in bats affected by White Nose Syndrome.  After grad school, Kat hopes to pursue a residency in wildlife anatomic pathology. When not in class or in the lab, she keeps quite busy putting out fires started by one of her three dogs or three cats.
