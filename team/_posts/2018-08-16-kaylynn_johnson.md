Kaylynn (PennVet class of '21) spent the summer of 2018 in the lab as a [NIH-BI research fellow](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/education/research-training-opportunities/nih-BI-research-program).  She was the first person in our lab to profile the microbiome in a large collection of stool samples generated by the PennVet Clinical Parasitology lab from dogs with defined parasite infections.  Her data showed a clear role for natural parasite infections in shaping the microbiome, and really set the stage for future work in the lab leading to [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.905604v1).
