Megan joined the lab in October of 2017 and was a keystone of the lab until she left to start a master's in biomedical sciences at [PCOM](https://www.pcom.edu/) in August of 2019.  Megan handled all day-to-day operations in the lab, but her main contribution to the success of the our group involved managing all aspects of our high-throughput sequencing projects.  This included everything from experiment planning; to executing technically challenging wet-lab experiments that transform raw biological samples into DNA suitable for sequencing; to operating sophisticated instrumentation used for sequencing; to troubleshooting failed experiments.  During her time in the lab, she single-handedly sequenced over 1200 samples spanning over 100 projects.  Megan has gone on to accomplish great things after leaving the laboratory.  After completing her master's degree, Megan got her Medical Degree at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) and is now beginning her residency in orthopedic surgery.  We never had any doubt that she was a superstar in the making!
