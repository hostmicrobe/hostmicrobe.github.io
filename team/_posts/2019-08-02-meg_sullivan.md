Megan joined the lab in October of 2017 and was a keystone of the lab until she left to start a master's in biomedical sciences at [PCOM](https://www.pcom.edu/) in August of 2019.  Megan handled all day-to-day operations in the lab, but her main contribution to the success of the our group involved managing all aspects of our high-throughput sequencing projects.  This included everything from experiment planning; to executing technically challenging wet-lab experiments that transform raw biological samples into DNA suitable for sequencing; to operating sophisticated instrumentation used for sequencing; to troubleshooting failed experiments.  During her time in the lab, she single-handedly sequenced over 1200 samples spanning over 100 projects.
