Camila initially came to spend a year in the lab as a PhD student participating in Brazil's 'sandwich' program.  During this time, she fell in love with bioinformatics and returned after her PhD to start a postdoc jointly between our lab and the laboratory of [Phil Scott](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/PHILLIPSCOTT).  Since she started her postdoc in January of 2018, she has taken the lead on advancing our understanding of the transcriptional response that drives skin pathology during cutaneous leishmaniasis.  Her [recent work]() identified key biomarkers that predict patient outcomes even before the first treatment has begun.  Currently, she is working to integrate data from multiple tissues and assays generated from patients in Brazil, in an effort improve our understanding of disease development.
