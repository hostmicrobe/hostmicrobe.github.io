Francislon spent a year in the lab (April 2017-2018) as part of the wonderful Brazilian 'sandwich' PhD program.  During this time he contributed to the earliest stages of our microbiomeDB project.  Even though only in the lab for a short time, his work was critical in building the core Shiny apps that are still used on our site for visualizing microbiome datasets.  His work led to [the first publication describing our database resource.](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1027)
