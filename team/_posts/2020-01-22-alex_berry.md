Alex completed his PhD in biology at UPenn, working in [Dustin Brisson's lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/brisson-lab/) where he studied the population genetics of *Trypanosoma cruzi* in Peru.  He was a postdoc with us from 2018-2020, during which time he instrumental in our studies of the microbiome in large animal models.  He was the first to show that natural parasite infections are a dominant factor in shaping microbiome structure in humans and animals (preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00670-20)), and his most recent work used pigs to understand the impact of pregnancy and pregnancy history (parity) on the microbiome and offspring colonization (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-021-01089-8)).  In addition, Alex  played a key role in supporting and developing our [transcriptomics course](http://diytranscriptomics.com/), and was one of the lead authors on [this perspectives piece]() that lays out our approach for teaching bioinformatics to bench biologists and how our curriculum was adapted to improve virtual content during the COVID19 pandemic.
