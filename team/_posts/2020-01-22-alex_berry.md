Alex completed his PhD in biology at UPenn, working in [Dustin Brisson's lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/brisson-lab/) where he studied the population genetics of *Trypanosoma cruzi* in Peru.  He joined us as a postdoc in August of 2018, and immediately began working on microbiome projects.  He was the first to show that natural parasite infections are a dominant factor in shaping microbiome structure in humans and animals (preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.905604v1)), and he continues to advance microbiome projects that leverage veterinary animal models.  In addition, Alex has played a key role in supporting and developing our [transcriptomics course](http://diytranscriptomics.com/), and is currently writing up a manuscript that outlines a model for how this class could be broadly utilized for teaching transcriptomics to parasitology and immunology researchers in the US as well as in in lower- and middle-income countries.
