Camila initially came to spend a year in the lab as a PhD student participating in Brazil's 'sandwich' program.  During this time, she fell in love with bioinformatics and returned after her PhD to start a postdoc jointly between our lab and the laboratory of [Phil Scott](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/PHILLIPSCOTT).  Since she started her postdoc in January of 2018, she has taken the lead on advancing our understanding of the transcriptional response that drives skin pathology during cutaneous leishmaniasis.  Her [initial studies](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aax4204) identified key biomarkers that predict patient outcomes even before the first treatment has begun, and [more recently](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009321) she demonstrated that localized skin infection with Leishmania elicits a chronic systemic inflammatory response in patients.  Currently, she is working to integrate data from multiomic assays generated from patients in Brazil, in an effort improve our understanding of disease development.
