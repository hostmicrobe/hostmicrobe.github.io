Camila initially came to spend a year in the lab as a PhD student participating in Brazil's 'sandwich' program.  During this time, she fell in love with bioinformatics and returned after her PhD to start a postdoc jointly between our lab and the laboratory of [Phil Scott](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/PHILLIPSCOTT).  During her postdoc, she took the lead on advancing our understanding of the transcriptional response that drives skin pathology during cutaneous leishmaniasis.  Her [initial studies](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aax4204) identified key biomarkers that predict patient outcomes even before the first treatment has begun, and [more recently](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009321) she demonstrated that localized skin infection with Leishmania elicits a chronic systemic inflammatory response in patients.  In her [most recent work](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adh1469) which involved a collaboration between our lab, the Scott lab, and Elizabeth Grice's lab, Camila identified a link between skin commensal microbes, in particular *Staphylococcus aureus*, and slower healing time in cutaneous leishmaniasis.  You can read more about that work in [this press release](https://hostmicrobe.org/projects/Leishmania/).  Camila left PennVet in 2023 and is currently a Senior Scientist in Computational Biology and Data Science at Century Therapeutics.
