Karen is a MD and Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS) fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  As part of her fellowship, she is spending 3 years in the lab learning about bench research.  She has taken the lead on an exciting new project for the lab, which involves testing whether the microbiome may be linked to severe pneumonia in children from lower- and middle-income countries.  To address this important question, Karen is using metagenomic profiling of archival samples from the [Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH)](https://perchresults.org/).  Karen is also pursuing a 'distance-learning' masters degree in Epidemiology through the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).  These combined efforts underscore her passion for negelected tropical diseases and global health.
