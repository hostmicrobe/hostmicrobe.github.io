Dan graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in Biology specializing in Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics. After graduation, Dan was commissioned into the U.S. Army as an Infantry Officer, serving in a Dismounted Reconnaissance Troop at Fort Drum, NY.  Dan is the sequencing guru in the lab, and he spends most of his time planning and executing all aspects of our high-throughput sequencing experiments.  As a result, he has developed a deep expertise in technology platforms ranging from 10x genomics, to Illumina, to automation equipment.  In his free time, Dan enjoys spending time with his wife, Michelle, and two cats, Enzo and Luca. He's also an avid fan of Formula 1 racing and working on his Land Rover.
