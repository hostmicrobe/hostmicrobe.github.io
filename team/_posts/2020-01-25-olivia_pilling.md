Olivia is a PhD student in the lab and is a member of the Microbiology, Virology and Parasitology (MVP) Graduate group.  Olivia's project is focused on the development of Selective Whole Genome Amplification (SWGA) to study the skin-dwelling parasite, *Leishmania braziliensis*.  She will test whether specially designed primer sets are capable of selectively amplifying *L. braziliensis* DNA even in the presence of substantial human DNA contamination.  If successful, this would constitute a breakthrough for the leishmania research field that would allow researchers to amplify whole *L. braziliensis* genomes directly from patient material to carry out population genetic studies of this important pathogen, without the need to culture or enrich parasites.
