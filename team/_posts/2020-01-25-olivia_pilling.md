Oliva is a PhD student in the Microbiology, Virology and Parasitology (MVP) Graduate group and spent her 1st rotation with us.  Oliva's project focused on the development of Selective Whole Genome Amplification (SWGA) to study the skin-dwelling parasite, *Leishmania braziliensis*.  She successfully identified primer sets that were capable of selectively amplifying *L. braziliensis* DNA even in the presence of substantial human DNA contamination.  This was a breakthrough for the leishmania research field that will allow researchers to amplify whole *L. braziliensis* genomes directly from patient material to carry out population genetic studies of this important pathogen, without the need to culture or enrich parasites.
