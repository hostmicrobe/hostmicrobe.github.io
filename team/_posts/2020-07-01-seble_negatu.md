Seble spent the Summer of 2020 'in the lab' (virutally, due to COVID) doing a rotation. She is a member of the Immunology Graduate Group (IGG), and her project focused on using bioinformatic tools to analyze single cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) from 3-dimensional cultures of intestinal epithelial cells in order to understand how these cells might be better poised to response to infection or inflammation.
