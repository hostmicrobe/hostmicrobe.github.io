Celine joined the lab in the Summer of 2023 as our first undergraduate through the [First Exposure to Research in the Biological Sciences (FERBS)](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pennferbs/).  She helped with the early planning stages of a large project the lab began to use metagenomic sequencing and immune profiling of samples from three African sites that participated in the [PERCH study](https://perchresults.org/).
