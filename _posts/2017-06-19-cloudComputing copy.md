## In a nutshell

MED clusters 16S rRNA gene amplicons (and other marker genes) in a sensitive manner.

The power of the algorithm comes from the principle of entropy minimization to achieve ecologically relevant units in high-throughput sequencing datasets of marker genes, which was introduced by oligotyping in 2013.

In a nutshell, MED

- **Does not perform pairwise sequence comparison**,

* **Does not rely on arbitrary sequence similarity thresholds**,

- **Does not require user supervision**,

* **Does not require preliminary classification or clustering results**,

- **Is agnostic to sampling strategy or how long your sequences are**,

* **Gives you 1 nucleotide resolution over any sequencing length with computational efficiency and minimal computational heuristics**.
